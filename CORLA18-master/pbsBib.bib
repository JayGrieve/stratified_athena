abstract = {The Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN) has produced the SCSN earthquake catalog from 1932 to the present, a period of more than 77 yrs. This catalog consists of phase picks, hypocenters, and magnitudes. We present the history of the SCSN and the evolution of the catalog, to facilitate user understanding of its limitations and strengths. Hypocenters and magnitudes have improved in quality with time, as the number of stations has increased gradually from 7 to [~]400 and the data acquisition and measuring procedures have become more sophisticated. The magnitude of completeness (Mc) of the network has improved from Mc[~]3.25 in the early years to Mc[~]1.8 at present, or better in the most densely instrumented areas. Mainshock-aftershock and swarm sequences and scattered individual background earthquakes characterize the seismicity of more than 470,000 events. The earthquake frequency-size distribution has an average b-value of [~]1.0, with M[&ge;]6.0 events occurring approximately every 3 yrs. The three largest earthquakes recorded were 1952 Mw 7.5 Kern County, 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers, and 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine sequences, and the three most damaging earthquakes were the 1933 Mw 6.4 Long Beach, 1971 Mw 6.7 San Fernando, and 1994 Mw 6.7 Northridge earthquakes. All of these events ruptured slow-slipping faults, located away from the main plate boundary fault, the San Andreas fault. Their aftershock sequences constitute about a third of the events in the catalog. The fast slipping southern San Andreas fault is relatively quiet at the microseismic level and has not had an M>6 earthquake since 1932. In contrast, the slower San Jacinto fault has the highest level of seismicity, including several M>6 events. Thus, the spatial and temporal seismicity patterns exhibit a complex relationship with the plate tectonic crustal deformation.

We consider the problem of finding \begin{equation*}\tag{1.1}\inf_{S_n\varepsilon\mathscr{S}(\nu_1,\cdots, \nu_n)} P\{S_n < \lambda\}\end{equation*} where ? is a positive constant. For n = 1, the infimum is 1 - ?1/? from the well-known Markov inequality. The solution for n = 2 was given in [2]. We derive the solution for n = 3. From these results we conjecture what the solution is for arbitrary n. To lend support to the conjecture, we examine a sub-class of S(?1, ?, ?n), namely those Sn's for which the problem reduces to one of considering the number of successes in independent trials. We show that, within this subclass, the conjectured value does minimize $P\{S_n < \lambda\}$ .},

     abstract = {Let X and Y be two random variables with continuous distribution functions F and G and means ? and ?. In a linear model, the crucial property of the contrast ? = ? - ? is that X + ? =L Y, where = L denotes equality in law. When the linear model does not hold, there is no real number ? such that X + ? = L Y. However, it is shown that if parameters are allowed to be function valued, there is essentially only one function $\Delta(\bullet)$ such that X + ?(X) = L Y, and this function can be defined by ?(x) = G-1(F(x)) - x. The estimate ?N(x) = Gn -1(Fm(x)) - x of ?(x) is considered, where Gn and Fm are the empirical distribution functions. Confidence bands based on this estimate are given and the asymptotic distribution of $\hat{\Delta}_N(\bullet)$ is derived. For general models in analysis of variance, contrasts that can be expressed as sums of differences of means can be replaced by sums of functions of the above kind.},

     abstract = {In the portion of the paper translated here, Neyman introduces a model for the analysis of field experiments conducted for the purpose of comparing a number of crop varieties, which makes use of a double-indexed array of unknown potential yields, one index corresponding to varieties and the other to plots. The yield corresponding to only one variety will be observed on any given plot, but through an urn model embodying sampling without replacement from this doubly indexed array, Neyman obtains a formula for the variance of the difference between the averages of the observed yields of two varieties. This variance involves the variance over all plots of the potential yields and the correlation coefficient r between the potential yields of the two varieties on the same plot. Since it is impossible to estimate r directly, Neyman advises taking r = 1, observing that in practice this may lead to using too large an estimated standard deviation, when comparing two variety means.},

annote = {This assumes a nuicance cell (i.e. something that you don't want to be considered really, but you must deal with since the population made selection based on that option). This also allows for more than one nuicance option to just be grouped together for the analysis and offer a different test stat based on if that proportion is quite high (>.80). There are two procedures offered: the first is when the p\_k (prop of nuicance cell k) is known and the second is a two stage where the p\_k is not known. In the second procedure the first step is to simply estiamte the p\_k from the data and then essentially impliment the first procedure now that the p\_k has been estimated. They also come up with some bounds on how large the sample must be. },

  abstract = {%
  Tabulation audits for an election provide statistical evidence that
  a reported contest outcome is ``correct''
  (meaning that the tabulation of votes was properly performed),
  or else the tabulation audit determines the correct outcome.
  \par
  Stark
  proposed \textbf{risk-limiting tabulation audits} for this purpose;
  such audits are effective and are beginning to be used in
  practice in Colorado and other states.
  \par
  We expand the study of election audits based on \textbf{Bayesian}
  methods.  Such Bayesian audits
  use a slightly different approach first introduced by Rivest and Shen in
  2012.  (The risk-limiting audits
  proposed by Stark are ``frequentist'' rather than Bayesian in
  character.)
  \par
  We first provide a simplified presentation of
  Bayesian tabulation audits.  
  Suppose an election has been run and the tabulation of votes
  reports a given outcome.
  A Bayesian tabulation audit begins by drawing a random sample of the votes
  in that contest, and tallying those votes.
  It then considers what effect statistical variations of this tally 
  have on the contest outcome.
  If such variations almost always yield the previously-reported outcome,
  the audit terminates, accepting the reported outcome.
  Otherwise the audit is repeated with an enlarged sample.
  \par
  Bayesian audits are attractive because they work with \textbf{any}
  method for determining the winner (such as ranked-choice voting).
  \par
  We then show how Bayesian audits may be extended to handle
  more complex situations, such as
  auditing contests that \emph{span multiple jurisdictions},
  or are otherwise ``stratified.''
  \par
  We highlight the auditing of such multiple-jurisdiction contests
  where some of the jurisdictions
  have an electronic cast vote record (CVR) for each cast paper vote,
  while the others do not.
  Complex situations such as this may arise naturally when some counties
  in a state have upgraded to new equipment, while others have not.
  Bayesian audits are able to handle such situations
  in a straightforward manner.
  \par
  We also discuss the benefits and relevant considerations for using
  Bayesian audits in practice.
