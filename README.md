# stratified_athena

This repository is my exploratory work on stratified audits, under Professor Vora. Specifically I'm working on 2-strata audits that make use of the Athena class of ballot polling audits for the ballot polling stratum in order to increase the efficiency (and therefore feasability) of stratified audits.

A lot of this code is pulled straight from [the SUITE work](https://github.com/pbstark/CORLA18/tree/master/code) and some is pulled from [the minerva branch of r2b2](https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2/tree/minerva).

This code is messy and ugly. For now I more focused on getting things working and producing meaningful results, less focused on code ready to be integrated into r2b2....

Please ask me any questions that come up. obroadrick@gwu.edu

# Examples

## Finding round sizes

Here is a plot illustrating the method I use to find the polling stratum round size that achieves a desired probability of stopping. Plotted over possible values for k (winner votes drawn in the round) are both the combined pvalue produced by that k (using 2-strata SUITE with Minerva for the polling stratum and a fixed 750 comparisons) as well as the probability of that k under the alternative hypothesis (a binomial distribution centered around the announced tally for the winner. All the numbers are based on the first example SUITE uses, a relatively tight margin of .0192.

From the plot, you can tell that this round size of 84 achieves a 90% probability of stopping because the value kmax such that Pr[k>=kmax | H_a] >= .9 and the pvalue corresponding to kmax is less than or equal to alpha (.1).

## Round sizes for various polling stratum sizes

Here is a plot of the ballot polling stratum minimum first round sizes that achieve 90% stopping probability for a 2-strata audit with ~2% margin, a fixed 750 ballots sampled in the comparison stratum, and various stratum sizes (on x-axis as percantage of total relevant ballots). Note that the 2-strata audit can reduce the number of ballots polled if a contest-wide polling audit were performed for significant polling stratum sizes (over half in this example). A tighter margin reduces the polling stratum size that still yields gains in efficiency, but even for this relatively tight race (~2% margin) more than half the relevant ballots can be in the polling stratum and still reduce the polling round size.
