\section{Sampling from subcollections} \label{sec:subcollections}

To audit contests that are contained on only a fraction of the ballots cast
in one or more counties efficiently requires the ability to sample from
just those ballots (or, at least, from a subset of all ballots that contains every such ballot).
Because the CVRs cannot be entirely trusted (otherwise, the audit would be superfluous),
we cannot rely on them to determine which ballots contain a given contest.
However, if we have independent knowledge of the number of ballots that
contain a given contest (e.g., from the SCORE system), then there are methods
that allow the sample to be drawn from ballots whose CVRs contain the contest
and still limit the risk rigorously.
See~\cite{benalohEtal11} and \cite{banuelosStark12} for details.
