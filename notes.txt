new plan:

take a fixed comparison stratum sample size (750) 

for several increasing ballot polling stratum sizes (11%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%):
    find an athena sample size that produces around 90% stopping probability
    then double that size and search around a bit to find the arlo sample size which produces similar(same) stopping probability
    do this for each of the new stratum allocations










OLD OUTDATED LAME TERRIBLE PLAN:
the plan is:

use the same data as in the suite paper example 1 (tight margin) 
assume that the dist of votes is same across both strata (if .7/.3 overall than also .7/.3 in each stratum, unlike numbers in suite example)

hold the sample of 750 ballots from the comparison stratum constant, assuming no errors

for different stratum sizes (the example is like 90 cvr, 10 nocvr, but we will slowly reduce cvr size)
    compute the comparison stratum sample size and then compute the required polling stratum sample size in order to stop (fisher's combo)
    for that risk limit (alpha) in the polling stratum, search for the sample size required to achieve 90% prob of stopping
        for a given sample size compute the binomial dist for the alt and null
        find the value kmax such that the alt dist to the right is 90% (prob)
        check if the value kmax passes the stopping condition for minerva (if ratio of tails is less than alpha)
        if it is than all great values of k would also stop so we have at least 90% prob of stopping so this is the value
do the same method but checking the arlo stopping condition (ratio of point value not tail) to find these values as well
