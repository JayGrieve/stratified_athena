# stratified_athena

This code is messy and ugly. Slowly working towards things making more sense, but for now I more focused on getting things working and producing meaningful results, less focused on code ready to be integrated into r2b2....

A lot of this code is pulled straight from [the SUITE work](https://github.com/pbstark/CORLA18/tree/master/code) and a few files are pulled from [the minerva branch of r2b2](https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2/tree/minerva).

All current work is on [the s2 branch of this repo](https://github.com/obroadrick/stratified_athena/tree/s2), s2 meaning 2 strata (CVR and no-CVR).

Please ask me any questions that come up.
