# stratified_athena

This code is messy and ugly. Slowly working towards things making more sense, but for now I more focused on getting things working and producing meaningful results, less focused on code ready to be integrated into r2b2....

A lot of this code is pulled straight from [the SUITE work](https://github.com/pbstark/CORLA18/tree/master/code) and a few files are pulled from [the minerva branch of r2b2](https://github.com/gwexploratoryaudits/r2b2/tree/minerva).

All work has been consolidated to master branch.

Please ask me any questions that come up.

# files
###  audit_s.py
Audit class from r2b2, modified to handle null hypotheses of any margin. 

### ballot_comparison.py
Ballot comparison file from SUITE.

### contest.py
Contest file from r2b2.

### contest_wide_round_size_script.py
Script for computing and storing the round size for contest-wide ballot polling audits with no stratification (both Minerva and R2 Bravo).

### data
Directory with json files containing results from various tests, simulations, and computations of round sizes.

### dist_pvalues.py
Incomplete script for creating a plot of the probability distribution over possible pvalues for a stratified audit.

### easy_read.py
Simple script for printing data from the json data files.

### election.py
Election file from r2b2.

### fishers_combination.py
Fishers combination functions from SUITE.

### hypergeometric.py
Hypergeometric functions from SUITE. (Not used?)

### minerva_s.py
Minerva file from r2b2 modified to handle a null hypothesis with nonzero margin.

### old
Some files that are no longer used from when I first started exploring this topic, including some functions (incomplete) for more than two strata.

### plot_data.py
Script that produces a plot of round sizes from the json data files.

### pvalue_dist_script.py
Incomplete script that creates a plot of the probability distribution over pvalues for a stratified audit.

### __pycache__
This is a python thing.

### README.md
This file.

### round_sizes.py
Functions for computing a first round size which accomplishes a given probability of stopping under the alternative hypothesis, that the election is truly as announced.

### simulations.py
Functions for simulating stratified audits. Also includes my own functions for computing the pvalue for one-round Minerva audits and R2 Bravo audits.

### simulation_script.py
Script for running simulations of stratified audits.

### sprt.py
Functions for R2 Bravo from SUITE.

### stratified_round_size_script.py
Script to compute the round size which accomplishes a given probability of stopping for various one-round stratified audits.
